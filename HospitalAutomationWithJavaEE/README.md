In this project we used Maven,JSF, Spring, JPA and MySQL. There is no need any server that EJB Container. Only Servlet Container is enough to run project and see on the browser. 

Only you must create a database that name is HospitalAutomation. After that go to persistence.xml file, and change "Table Generation Stragety" to Create. When you run project firstly tables will be created in MySQL. After that again go to persistence.xml and change table generation stragety to non.

Now you can easiliy run the project.
